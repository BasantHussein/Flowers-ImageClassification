# Data Scientist Nanodegree
## Flowers-ImageClassification

### Introduction

Developed an image classifier built with PyTorch, then converted it into a command-line application

### Data

https://drive.google.com/file/d/13TNmSNXvRyLPtzbEE_FCHyVIy2ucsNCb/view?usp=sharing

### Steps

1. Loading the data, Building and training the classifier using a pre-trained model "Mobilenet" 
2. Building a classifier 
3. Testing the network 

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x**

### Run

```bash
ipython notebook Image Classifier Project.ipynb

```  
or
